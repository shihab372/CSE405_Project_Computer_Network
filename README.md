# 🖧 Computer Networking Project – Corporate Campus Network Simulation

## 🔖 Project Title

**Data Communication in a Network – Corporate Campus Expansion**

---

## 📄 Project Overview

This project simulates a scalable network infrastructure for a large corporate campus comprising **five major buildings**:

* Headquarters
* Sales Office
* Tech Center
* Human Resources
* Finance Division

Each building is equipped with:

* A **dedicated router**
* A **DHCP server** for dynamic IP assignment
* **Three client PCs**

The network is built using **Class A IP addressing**, and routers are interconnected using the **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** protocol for dynamic routing.

The **Headquarters** hosts:

* A **DNS Server** to resolve `www.campusnet.com`
* A **Web Server** accessible from all other buildings

Simulated browser-based applications are included to demonstrate business processes like:

* Employee onboarding
* Asset management
* Invoice processing
